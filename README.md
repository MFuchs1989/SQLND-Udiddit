## Introduction

As a data analyst, I have been assigned the task of producing a meaningful report on deforestation worldwide for ForestQuery, a non-profit organization whose mission is to reduce deforestation around the world and raise awareness about this important environmental issue. 

Its management aims to find out in which countries and regions around the world forests appear to be shrinking and in which countries and regions forest cover is greatest, both in terms of quantity and percentage of total land area.

## Data Provided

Three tables were provided that included information on afforestation as well as total area and regional groupings.

+ forest_area.csv
+ land_area.csv
+ regions.csv


<a name="project_results"></a>

## Project Results

The report includes five sections:

+ Global Situation
+ Regional Outlook
+ Country-Level Detail
+ Recommendations
+ Appendix: SQL queries used

Analysis has shown that forest cover is slowly but steadily disappearing.
The most affected region is sub-Saharan Africa. However, other countries, such as Iceland, have been able to increase their forest cover over time.

## Project Motivation: 

As an [enthusiastic Data Scientist](https://michael-fuchs-python.netlify.app/), the collection and preparation of data is central, in addition to the creation of Machine / Deep Learning models. 
This project and its leading courses showed me how to use SQL queries to define, [select](https://michael-fuchs-sql.netlify.app/2021/03/23/data-wrangling/), [manipulate](https://michael-fuchs-sql.netlify.app/2021/03/29/data-manipulation/), control access to, [aggregate](https://michael-fuchs-sql.netlify.app/2021/03/26/data-aggregation/) and join data and data tables. 
Furthermore, the treatment of [subqueries](https://michael-fuchs-sql.netlify.app/2021/04/01/subqueries/), various window functions as well as partitions to complete complex tasks was central.
